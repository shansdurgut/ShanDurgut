# About Me
Hi, I'm Shan Durgut, an RF localization and sensor fusion engineer. I design cutting-edge indoor tracking systems that merge data from Ultra-Wideband and Bluetooth sensors using advanced AI models. Recently, I developed a hybrid solution that uses a combination of LSTM and CNN architectures to fuse UWB and BLE data, achieving real-time, high-precision positioning in challenging environments. This approach can significantly enhance applications in smart buildings, robotics, and asset tracking. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging these technologies to solve real-world problems.
